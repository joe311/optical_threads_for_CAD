To install copy all *.xml files to <br> __%localappdata%\Autodesk\webdeploy\Production\<version ID>\Fusion\Server\Fusion\Configuration\ThreadData__

The easiest way to do this is navigate to %localappdata%\Autodesk\webdeploy\Production\
Select the newest version ID (looks like gibberish, e.g. 1a27f23c10bc87f7eab1f89e440a46f886b5f544)<br>
Navigate deeper to \Fusion\Server\Fusion\Configuration\ThreadData

<br>
Note that when you update fusion you might need to reinstall the xml files to the new version ID number. 

In Fusion threads are selected by size, but then in Designation give a full name.
